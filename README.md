# ScarsProject

This repository is dedicated to the exploration and analysis of the PXP model, utilizing the power of the QuTiP library for quantum simulations. The PXP model, known for its relevance in quantum many-body physics, is studied here through various computational techniques to understand its dynamics and eigenstate properties.

## Overview

The PXP model simulations are performed using the QuTiP library, a comprehensive toolkit for quantum information processing and quantum optics simulations. This repository contains code for simulating time evolution, analyzing eigenstates, and evaluating overlaps between states in the context of the PXP model.
